## this project is a how to tutorial which explore the basics of Flask API's and SQL databases.

### table of contents

1.  set-up (this document) - virtual enviroment, pip and gitignore
2.  hello_world - the bare bones basics of flask. build an api that only makes GET requests with several routes, intro to url parameters and string HTML formatting
3.  second_flask_app - Build a flask API which incorperate some dummy data, look at HTML templates static CSS files and JSON.
4.  myfirst_database - set up basic SQLite3 development data base and make SQL queries, learn about SQL, manipulating data and learn about related tables.
5.  flaskAlchemy - use the flask SQLAlchemy ORM to build a a basic API use Postman to make GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests to your database, explore file sturcture for larger projects.
6.  MySQL - Put it all together with a MySQL production grade database.

# set up

A. Set up virtual enviroment make some pip intalls and create a .gitignore

     do not push to github until after we create our .gitignore

1. open your command line in the directory this file is in `/howto_flask`
2. check what version of python you have installed locally. run `python --version`
3. if your version if less than 3 make sure you have python 3 or greater installed, run `python3 --version`
   if you do not have Python3 installed follow this tutorial: https://realpython.com/installing-python/

4. We need to create a virutal enviorment to run our python in. This helps keep your imports and pkgs specific to your current project. Create a virtual enviorment with one of the following commands:

   `python3 -m venv myenv`

   this command is calling python3 specificly because you may have multiple version of python installed. if your main version is above 3 just run

   `python -m venv myenv`

   '-m venv' creates a virutal enviroment and 'myenv' is the path to this enviorment. in this case it creates a folder 'myenv' in our current dir.

5. Now that we have a virutal enviorment lets spin it up.
   - Unix: `source /myenv/bin/activate`
   - Win: `.\env\Scripts\activate`

typically this just shows up in my command line by showing '(myenv)' before my prompt. it may look diffrent in windows.

6. when your have our venv up and running we can download the pkgs we are going to use.
   with your virtual enviroment turned on install Flask.
   `pip install flask`

   once this is installed cd into hello_world and run in your command line run app.py `flask run`

7. your terminal should show 'running on `http://127.0.0.1:xxxx` 127.0.0.1 is your local host and :xxxx is the port number. open up your web browser and go to `http://localhost:xxxx` (i think flask be default runs on port 5000)

8. The base route '/' takes the viwer to the text 'Howdy World!' and if you go to '/yourname' you will see the message 'Howdy yourname'.

   Great, you've installed Flask correctly.

9. to create your .gitignore cd out of hello_world and into the same dir as myenv run `touch .gitignore`

10. open your gitignore file and paste in the following, save and close

    ```
      .myenv
      myenv/

      .DS_Store
      .env
      .flaskenv
      *.pyc
      *.pyo
      env/
      venv/
      .venv/
      env*
      dist/
      build/
      *.egg
      *.egg-info/
      .tox/
      .cache/
      .pytest_cache/
      .idea/
      docs/_build/
      .vscode

      __pycache__/
      hello_world/__pycache__/
      second_flask_app/__pycache__/
      myfirst_database/__pycache__/
      myfirst_database/database.db
      flaskAlchemy/__pycache__/
    ```

## you are set up

next you will want to open
`/hello_world/app.py` and read the comments

you can read about venv here https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.

and the Flask documents are located here:
